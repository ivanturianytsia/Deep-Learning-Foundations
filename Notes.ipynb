    "## Linear regression\n",
    "**Linear regression** is a method of finding best fitting values *m* and *b* for a line (*y = mx + b*), which passes through the points of a given array with a minimal mean error. Linear regression uses **gradient descent** to closesly approach the local minimum, by computing a partial derivative for each *m* and *b* along the way. As the line approaches the minimal error, derivatives decrease as well as iteration step:\n",
    "```\n",
    "new_b = b_current - (learningRate * b_gradient)\n",
    "new_m = m_current - (learningRate * m_gradient)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate and number of iterations is chosen manualy. Wrong learning rate, too big or too small, decreases the speed of reaching the vertex. If the learning rate is too small, low derivative will slow the descent down drastically, so the values may not reach the lower point at all. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too big, iterations will reach some level in the lower part quickly, by jumping from slope to slope in zig-zags, but they might not precisely reach the bottom of the curve in any reasonable time/number of iterations.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Neural network** - a network of neurons, which convert input data to output data. \n",
    "A **neuron** or **perceptrons** resemble a body, dendrites (inputs) and an axon (output). As signals enter the neuron through inputs, they are multiplied by **weights** - measure of how much each signal means to the output signal. Then, weighted signals are summed. The resulting signal is feeded through the **activation function**, usually a **sigmoid**, in order to normalize the output.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def sigmoid(x):\n",
    "    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n",

    "### Backpropagation\n",
    "As the neural network will grow to have 1 or more **hidden layers**, learning will become impossible with only gradient descent. To calculate the error we need to know the desired output on the neuron, and we don't have that in hidden layers. Here comes **backpropagation** - extension of gradient descent method, that bases on chain rule, where we estimate the error of the hidden layer basing on the weights, that connect them to the output.\n",
    "```\n",
    "delta_error_hidden = dot(weights_hidden_output, delta_error_output) * sigmoid_derivative(dot(inputs, weights_input_hidden))\n",

    "This rule is more general, thus, neural networks with any number of hidden layers can be easily trained:\n",
